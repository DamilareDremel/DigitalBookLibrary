Library Management System 
#Summary 
#My code does the following: 
-Implements the Book, Library, and DigitalLibrary classes as requested. 
-Correctly manages book borrowing, returning, adding, removing, and downloading functionality. 
-Encapsulates the isbn property properly and uses private fields and getter methods as required. 
-Uses require to handle module imports, consistent with a Node.js environment.
